# **App Name**: TriSlide

## Core Features:

- Grid Display: Display a triangular grid of colored tiles.
- Tile Interaction: Implement a drag-and-drop interface for sliding rows or diagonals of tiles to create matches of 3 or more tiles of the same color. Matched tiles are removed, and new tiles fall into place from the top.
- Score Tracking: Track the user's score based on the number of matched tiles. Higher scores are achieved by creating longer matches.
- Game Persistence: Implement local storage of user's game state, allowing users to resume previous games.
- Animation Hints: Smooth animations for tile slides, matches, and new tile appearances to enhance user experience.

- Clean and readable font for score and controls.
- Centralized triangular grid layout with score and controls at the top.
